Project that creates different visual effects based on human interaction with the computer, through KINECT V2, a Microsoft sensor.
The computer graphics were generated with Processing 3, with the support of the following libraries:

- KinectPV2
- oscP5
- netP5
- megamu.mesh
- gab.opencv
- blobDetection

Furthermore, it sends the processed data, collect by the KINECT, and sends it to Pure Data, through OSCP5.



### Execution

To be able to run the programs individually, it's necessary to copy the Communication file into the other folders. Next, just select the file to be executed, open in Processing3 and run.
Obs: The computer running the programs must be connected with a KINECT V2.
