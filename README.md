selfhood is an academic project developed by CTI-Renato Archer in partnership with NICS-Unicamp. It aims the creation of an interactive environment to generate both autitive and visual effects based on data collect by KinectV2. Thus we not only adapted existing programs, but also created our own with the help of Processing 3 and its auxiliar libraries. 


### Software

In order to execute the programs in this repository, you must isntall the following libraries in your Processing3 IDE:

| Library | Link |
| ------ | ------ |
| KinectPV2 | [ThomasLengeling/KinectPV2](https://github.com/ThomasLengeling/KinectPV2) |
| oscP5 | [oscp5/src/main/java/oscP5/](https://github.com/sojamo/oscp5) |
| netP5 | [oscp5/src/main/java/netP5/](https://github.com/sojamo/oscp5/tree/master/src/main/java/netP5) |
| megamu.mesh | [leebyron/mesh](https://github.com/leebyron/mesh) |
| gab.opencv | [opencv-processing/src/gab/opencv/] (https://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing/tree/master/src/gab/opencv)|
| blobDetection | [processing/BlobDetection/](http://www.v3ga.net/processing/BlobDetection/) |

You can install them directly via your Processing3 IDE. To do so, execute the following steps:

- click on Sketch button
- click on Import Library
- click on Add Library
- select the wishing library and click install

### Execution

KinectPv2 library requires at least Windows8 to run.
After you certificate that KinectV2 is connected, you can run the program pressing the play button on Processing3 IDE.



### Todos

 - Unify programs in only one  file combining all visual effects
